# Waterpotability
Water is an important and essential component of human life as well as all plant and living species. Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.
Therefore there is a need for classification of potability of available water and hence decisions can be taken by authorities for treating before supplying to communities
Dataset
The dataset consists of following features which shall be taken as input from the user. Using our prediction model over the provided inputs, we are going to predict whether the water is potable or not with regards to the input provided. The following were the attributes in the given dataset.

pH: pH of the given water sample
HARDNESS: Hardness of the water sample
SOLIDS: Solid contents of the water
CHLORAMINES: Amount of Chloramines in the water
SULFATE: Amount of Sulfates in water
CONDUCTIVITY: Conductivity of the given water sample
ORGANIC CARBON: The carbon content in the water
TRIHALOMETHANES: Amount of halogen-methane in the water sample
TURBIDITY: Turbidity of the given water sample.

Exploratory data analysis(EDA):
There are missing values in the dataset. All the missing values are imputed with different techniques. After imputation of missing values, EDA is performed on the dataset and got few insights. For detailed explaination please refer python file present in this repository.

. Evaluation
Goal: Determine whether a sample of water is potable or not.
